# F1 Exploratory Data Analysis

As I'm testing various visualization packages and ideas I'm going to be using old data that only goes upto 2020.

The first chart shows the total number of races each season and the most number of races won by a single driver.

## Short Term Goal

Testing various visualization packages like Plotly, Dash, Bokeh, Seaborn and D3

## Long Term Goal

Build a full fledged web app that has a complete array of charts giving you in depth analysis of Formula 1
